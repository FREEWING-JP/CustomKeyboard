## Advance Feature

Our production also has some advance features such as **Macro** (continuously send key to computer), **Multi-media control** (eg. paly/pause music), **Mouse clicking simulation**... 

### Macro

A **Macro** is an array of keys sending to computer sequentially. (eg. password,command,hotkeys.) With **Macro**, you can achieve some certain purpose by click one switch on the keyboard. 

* The gif below offers an example of setting up "Open terminal" to a certain switch.

![setmarco](Readme.assets/setmarco.gif)

* (Win+R) :  Run window will pop up
* (Delay 0.6s + C) : Wait for Run window pop up and type "c"
* (M) : Type "m"
* (D) :  Type "d"
* (Enter) : Type "enter"

The final result is showed below:

When you press "KEY3" , a command window will instantly show up,It acts like a bad USB!

* You can also set **One-key Password** on a certain switch.

## Notice

### Non-Windows system usage:

The Keyboard should finish setting on windows pc **first** ,Then plug into other OS. If you are using MacOS, the "Win" key is equal to "command" and "alt" = "option".

### Software related:

ZDDKeyboradSetter.exe opened and the font is too large: Try to shrink your font size, right click on your desktop select "Display settings".

### Configure related:

1. If you have 2 or more keyboard, you can not set them at the same time, the software can only recognize one device.
2. The virtual keyboard inside this software is fully refer to the 128key keyboard. eg: if you want to set  '=' ,you should press ![image-20211025214104776](Readme.assets/image-20211025214104776-16377365559223.png). if you want to set '+', you should press 'Shift' first ,the press  ![image-20211025214104776](Readme.assets/image-20211025214104776.png).
3. If you set a key using some keypad keys, and these keys do not work, check whether you pressed 'Num Lock' key first.

### Macro related:

1. The total macro key length is 34 normal key (eg: 'a','b','1','Caps Lock'...) with maximum 10 function key (eg:'Ctrl','Win','Alt'...), 34 is the maximum sum number, not for one key, because this chip has only 128 Byte on-chip  memory.
2. Mouse key and Media key can not be added to the macro.
3. The delay function can not apply to a single key(eg: Delay2.5s+d),it is only worked in macro mode,and the delay function can only be a prefix.
4. You should press a key for enough time to trigger loop sending.
5. F13~F24 can be found in 'Advance' page, they act like normal keys (1,2,3,q,w,e,F1...).
